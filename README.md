# The tRackIT R-package

The tRackIT R-Package provides functionalities for the processing of data recorded in local automatic radio-tracking studies. It is specifically tailored to data recorded with one of the sensors from the [tRackIT ecosystem](https://dx.doi.org/10.18420/informatik2021-035) (tRackIT-Stations, BatRack), but can also be used for other systems. The functionalities provided in the package cover project and individual management, raw signal data processing and the generation of high-level information such as the [calculation of locations]( https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13294) and the [classification of behavioral states](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.22.485147)  based on pattern in the recorded vhf-signals. It provides a default data structure to guarantee easy exchangeability of data and analysis scripts between scientists.
