\description{
Filtering of raw signals based on transmitter frequency, signal duration and runtime of the transmitter. The function reads files from a given folder. Make shure that there is one file per station and that they have the following columns:timestamp= time of received signal-expected format: â€œ\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S (e.g. 1970-01-29 15:30:22:11),  duration=signal length of the recorded signal, frequency= frequency in kHz (e.g. 150150.2),  max= the max signal strength in dBW of the recorded signal (peak) , receiver= name of the receiver device (usually 0,1,2,3 for a 4 Antenna station ), station= name of the station as character string
